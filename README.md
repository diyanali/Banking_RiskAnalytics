# Banking Risk Analytics

OBJECTIVES:
Develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

DATA:
This dataset basically contains information about bank details ,various client details which consists of multiple tables which are interlinked with each other through keys like primary key and foreign key.
The various tables are Banking Relationship, Client-Banking, Gender, Investment Advisor and Period.

INSIGHTS:
Deposits and Savings Behavior
The high correlation between Bank Deposits and Saving Accounts suggests that these may either measure overlapping financial behavior (e.g., total funds a customer keeps in the bank) or that people who actively deposit funds also tend to maintain or grow savings balances.

Income, Age, and Accumulation
Moderate correlations of Age and Estimated Income with various balances (Superannuation, Savings, Checking) reflect a common financial lifecycle trend: higher income earners and older individuals often accumulate more savings, retirement funds, and may carry higher credit card balances or loans.

Low Correlation with Properties Owned
Property ownership may depend on external factors (location, real estate market conditions, inheritance, etc.) that are not captured by these particular banking variables. Hence, we see weaker correlations here.

Business vs. Personal Banking
Business Lending’s moderate link to Bank Loans suggests some customers may have both personal and business debts. However, business lending is relatively uncorrelated with other deposit or property-related metrics, indicating it may serve a distinct subset of customers or needs.

DASHBOARD:
The project is a banking project where we have used a banking dataset. Here in this dashboard we are going to show features like Loan analysis and Deposit Analysis and summary of the overall dataset.
